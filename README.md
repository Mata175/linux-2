# Linux 2 — Intermediate Linux

Training material — slides, exercises, cheatsheets — for the Linux 2 course.

This master branch contains always the material for the latest course, and past courses are stored in tags.

# Type conventions

On top of [general training template instructions](https://github.com/csc-training/slide-template/blob/master/docs/syntax-guide.md), the following conventions should be followed:

- **Slide titles** should start with capital letter, but otherwise no capitalisation for other words.

- Intending bulletpoints should be done with two spaces.

- For representing commands and keypresses inline with text, single backticks (\`…\`) should be used.

- Command examples should use code block syntax for bash (\```bash …\```)
